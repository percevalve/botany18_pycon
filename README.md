# Botany18 PyCon UK competition
Those are the bots I created for the Botany18 PyCon tournament.

The comments have been added later for clarity. Results for the bots are available [here](http://botany18.pyconuk.org)

For credits and more information of the tournament, see on the [GitHub for Botany](https://github.com/inglesp/botany)
